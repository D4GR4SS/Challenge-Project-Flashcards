# Flashcards App

## Codecademy Course Challenge Project: Flashcards

This project focuses on building a flashcard-style quiz app using Redux and Redux Toolkit. Users will be able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. The app allows users to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project are to practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. The project involves the following tasks:

1. Implement Redux logic for managing topics.
2. Implement Redux logic for managing quizzes.
3. Implement Redux logic for managing flashcards.
4. Allow users to create their own topics, quizzes, and flashcards.
5. Enable interaction with quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## Overview

Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project provides a series of open-ended requirements that describe the project you'll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when encountering problems that cannot be easily solved.

## Project Structure

The project will involve implementing the app's Redux logic in the following order:

1. Topics: Manage topics and associated quizzes.
2. Quizzes: Manage quizzes and associated flashcards.
3. Flashcards: Manage flashcards for each quiz.

Feel free to implement these tasks in a different order if it is more comfortable for you.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine and follow the instructions provided in the project requirements. You'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine to run the app.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd flashcards-app
npm install
npm start
```
